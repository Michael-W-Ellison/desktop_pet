---

### 3. 🧩 LSTM Networks (Memory System)

**What it does**: Gives the pet true memory of past events

**Technical Details**:
- **Architecture**: 2-layer stacked LSTM
- **Hidden Size**: 32 neurons per layer
- **Sequence Length**: Remembers last 50 interactions
- **Gates**: Forget, Input, Output gates for selective memory
- **BPTT**: Backpropagation Through Time for sequence learning

**How Memory Works**:
```
Without LSTM: "I like being fed" (simple preference)
With LSTM: "Yesterday evening at 7pm, she played ball for 20 minutes,
           then fed me. It's 6:55pm now - she'll probably play soon!"
```

**Your child will notice**:
- Pet remembers what happened earlier today
- Recognizes daily routines ("it's evening, time to play!")
- Responds differently based on recent history
- Anticipates regular patterns (feeding times, play times)
- Forms "opinions" about sequences of events

---

### 4. 🎯 Multiple Specialized Networks

**What it does**: Different "brains" for different tasks

**The Four Networks**:

#### A. MovementNetwork
- **Purpose**: Strategic positioning and pathfinding
- **Inputs**: Position, target location, energy, edges, personality
- **Outputs**: Velocity (x, y), whether to move
- **Learns**: Optimal movement patterns for different goals

#### B. ActivityNetwork
- **Purpose**: Chooses activities based on context
- **Type**: LSTM network (remembers activity sequences)
- **Outputs**: ball_play, mouse_chase, hide_seek, explore, sleep, eat
- **Learns**: Which activities are best for different moods/times

#### C. EmotionNetwork
- **Purpose**: Manages emotional state
- **Emotions**: Joy, Excitement, Contentment, Anxiety, Loneliness
- **Effect**: Emotions modify ALL other behaviors
  - High excitement → faster movement, more playful
  - High contentment → slower movement, less energy drain
  - High loneliness → seeks interaction more

#### D. SocialNetwork
- **Purpose**: Learns player's patterns
- **Type**: LSTM network (learns schedules)
- **Learns**:
  - When player usually interacts
  - What type of interactions they prefer
  - Time of day patterns
  - Weekend vs weekday differences

**Network Coordinator**:
Combines all four networks intelligently:
1. EmotionNetwork updates first (affects everything else)
2. SocialNetwork predicts player behavior
3. ActivityNetwork chooses what to do (influenced by emotions and player prediction)
4. MovementNetwork decides how to move (influenced by activity and emotions)

**Your child will notice**:
- More realistic emotional responses
- Pet "thinks" about what to do next
- Emotions visibly affect behavior (excited = zooms around)
- Pet anticipates when they'll come home from school
- Different response if they've been playing vs ignoring it

---

### 5. 👁️ Sensory Input System

**What it does**: Pet can "see" and "sense" its environment

**28 Sensory Inputs**:

#### Time Awareness (9 inputs)
- Hour of day (sin/cos encoding for circularity)
- Is morning / afternoon / evening / night
- Day of week (sin/cos encoding)
- Is weekend

#### Mouse Tracking (11 inputs)
- Mouse position (x, y) normalized
- Mouse velocity (x, y) normalized
- Distance to creature
- Angle to creature (sin, cos)
- Is mouse approaching
- Mouse speed category (slow/medium/fast)

#### Proximity Sensors (8 inputs)
- Distance to each screen edge (top/bottom/left/right)
- Distance to nearest icon
- Angle to nearest icon
- Count of nearby icons
- Is near hiding spot

**Environmental Awareness**:
- Detects desktop icons as obstacles and hiding spots
- Tracks mouse movement and predicts approach
- Knows time of day and adjusts behavior
- Understands screen boundaries

**Your child will notice**:
- Pet hides behind specific icons it has learned are good spots
- Knows when mouse is moving toward it
- Adjusts behavior based on time (sleepier at night)
- Explores new areas of screen intelligently
- Reacts to desktop layout changes

### 6. 🎮 Reinforcement Learning (Goal System)

**What it does**: Pet learns through trial-and-error to achieve goals

**Q-Learning Implementation**:
- **State Space**: 35 dimensions (creature stats + sensory inputs)
- **Action Space**: 10 discrete actions
- **Discount Factor**: γ = 0.95 (values future rewards)
- **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy (starts at 100%, decays to 10%)
- **Experience Replay**: Stores 10,000 past experiences

**The 10 Actions**:
1. Chase Mouse
2. Explore
3. Seek Food
4. Hide
5. Play with Ball
6. Sleep
7. Move to Center
8. Stay Still
9. Seek Player Interaction
10. Random Wander

**Reward Function** (what pet tries to maximize):
```
Reward =
  + 0.1 * happiness_increase
  - 2.0 * (if hunger > 80)
  - 1.0 * (if energy < 20)
  + 0.5 * (alive bonus)
  - 50.0 * (if died)
  + 2.0 * (if player interacted)
  + 1.5 * (if successfully ate when hungry)
  + 1.0 * (if caught ball)
  + 0.3 * (curiosity bonus for new actions)
```

**Goal-Oriented Behavior**:
Pet automatically sets goals based on state:
- If hunger > 70: Goal = "seek_food"
- If energy < 25: Goal = "rest"
- If happiness < 40: Goal = "seek_interaction"
- If player nearby: Goal = "play"
- Else: Goal = "explore"

**Learning Process**:
1. Pet is in a state
2. RL agent chooses action (explore new things or exploit learned strategy)
3. Pet performs action
4. Reward calculated based on outcome
5. Experience stored in replay buffer
6. Pet learns from batch of past experiences
7. Q-values updated to predict better actions

**Your child will notice**:
- Pet actively seeks food when hungry (not random)
- Learns optimal times to sleep/play/explore
- Tries new behaviors to see what works
- Develops strategies over weeks (e.g., "stay near mouse in evening")
- Makes surprisingly intelligent decisions
- Genuinely goal-seeking behavior

---

## 🔬 How It All Works Together

### Typical Decision Process (ADVANCED Mode):

```
1. Sensory System: "Mouse at (500, 300), moving fast, evening time,
                    creature hungry (65), happy (75), energetic (80)"

2. Emotion Network: "Based on hunger and recent interactions:
                     Joy: 0.6, Excitement: 0.7, Anxiety: 0.4"
                     → Emotional modifiers: speed +40%, playfulness +35%

3. Social Network: "It's 7pm on Tuesday - player usually interacts now
                    (85% probability). Likely to play ball or feed."

4. Activity Network (LSTM): "Recent sequence: explore → hide → feed
                            Given emotions and time, best action: seek_interaction"

5. Movement Network: "Activity is seek_interaction, emotions are excited
                     → Move toward center of screen (where player looks)
                     → Speed: 4.2 pixels/frame (modified by excitement)"

6. RL System: "Current goal: seek_interaction. This aligns with networks.
              Q-value for 'seek_interaction' action: 0.85 (good!)
              Execute with 15% exploration (might try something new)"

7. Final Decision:
   - Activity: Seek player interaction
   - Movement: Toward center at 4.2px/frame
   - Emotion: Excited and hopeful
   - Goal: Get player to interact
```

### Learning After Interaction:

```
Player clicks and pets the creature!

1. Reward Calculation:
   - Happiness increased: +5 → reward +0.5
   - Player interacted: +2.0
   - Interaction was positive: +1.0
   - Total reward: +3.5 (very good!)

2. Movement Network learns:
   - "Moving to center when seeking interaction → worked!"
   - Strengthens that pattern

3. Activity Network (LSTM) learns:
   - Sequence: [explore, hide, feed, seek_interaction] → positive outcome
   - More likely to seek interaction after being fed

4. Emotion Network learns:
   - "Evening + moderate hunger + recent feeding → excitement works!"

5. Social Network learns:
   - "Tuesday 7pm → player interacts" (confidence: 87% → 89%)

6. RL System learns:
   - Q-value for "seek_interaction" in this state: 0.85 → 0.91
   - Experience stored in replay buffer
   - Learns from batch of similar past experiences
```
